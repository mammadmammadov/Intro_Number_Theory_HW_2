1) Write a program to compute the greatest common divisor gcd(a, b) of two integers a and b. Your program should work even if one of a or b is zero. Make sure that you donâ€™t go into an infinite loop if a and b are both zero!

2) Write a program to implement 3n+1 algorithm. The user will input n and your program should return the length L(n) and the terminating value T(n) of the 3n+1 algorithm. Use your program to create a table giving the length and terminating value for all starting values 1<=n<=100
